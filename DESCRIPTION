Description: The package implements the sparse autoencoder in R environment, following the notes of Andrew Ng (http://www.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs294a/cs294a.1104/sparseAutoencoder.pdf). The features learned by the hidden layer of the autoencoder (through unsupervised learning of unlabeled data) can be used in constructing deep belief neural networks.
